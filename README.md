# Lunch
To Do:

Create Welcome page:

-Directions on how to use app(maybe add this as a separate page with a button to get there)

-Button for Nolans

-Button for FFC

FFC page:

-Figure out how to ping users(hard)

-Scroll wheel

-Pop up that shows up when button is clicked.

-Zoom in and out of app?(optional depending on difficulty)

-Optional: Messaging features -use twilio

-Geolocator pinging(if this doesn't work, ping everyone on app)

-Design/UI cleanup

Nolan's page:

-Same thing as ffc.

-figure out how to switch pages(using viewcontroller I think?)
